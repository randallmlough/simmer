# Simmer - dynamic boilerplate code from your data models and client facing data types.

For most applications your data models and client data types are fairly static. You want to receive data in a specific way and store your data in a specific way. In between the request, storage, and response a number of things may happen to ensure data integrity and reliability, such as; validation, normalization, error handling and so on. It's these in between steps where a lot of boilerplate code comes into play and where Simmer fits in.

Simmer gathers all your client data types, and your data models to be used for code generation. Create your own reflection free ORM, conversion tools and much, much more. Simmer gives the developer to use pre-defined templates or their own.
